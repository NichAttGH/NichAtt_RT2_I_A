# Assignment Research Track2

The assignment is divided in three parts:.
* Creating a full documentation using Sphinx or Doxygen for the [RT1 II assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git).



## First Task

In this part of the work, after installing Sphinx and ReadTheDocs theme, I just commented the codes of the RT1_II_A, and the page with all the documentation was created.  
All the new documentation can be found in [this link](https://nichattgh.github.io/NichAtt_RT2_I_A/).

## Second Task

In this second pard, after installing Jupyter Notebook, we must write a Jupyter file that represents this goals:
- Some buttons for handling the motion of the robot in the environment;
- A plot with the robot’s position and targets’ positions in the environment;
- A text box with the distance of the closest obstacle (or the overall plot of the laserscanner);
- A plot for the number of reached/not-reached targets.

Remember that, again, we reference to the [II° assignment of Research Track 1](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git)

### Initialization
We need to load jupyter cells so at the beginning we import everything we need
