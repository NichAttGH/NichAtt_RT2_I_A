# Assignment Research Track2

The assignment is divided in three parts:.
* Creating a full documentation using Sphinx or Doxygen for the [RT1 II assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git).
* Write a Jupyter file that represents these goals:
  - Some buttons for handling the motion of the robot in the environment;
  - A plot with the robot’s position and targets’ positions in the environment;
  - A text box with the distance of the closest obstacle (or the overall plot of the laserscanner);
  - A plot for the number of reached/not-reached targets
* Write a report, about the [RT1 I assignment code](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_I_A.git), composed of:
  - Hypotheses made;
  - Description and motivation of the experimental setup;
  - Results;
  - Discussion of the results with statistical analysis;
  - Conclusion

## First Task

In this part of the work, after installing Sphinx and ReadTheDocs theme, I just commented the codes of the RT1_II_A, and the page with all the documentation was created.  
All the new documentation can be found in [this link](https://nichattgh.github.io/NichAtt_RT2_I_A/).

## Second Task

After installing Jupyter Notebook, remember that we reference to the [II° assignment of Research Track 1](https://github.com/NichAttGH/NichAtt_RT1_II_A.git)

### Initialization
We need to load jupyter cells so at the beginning we import everything we need

```
# import ros and jupyter stuff
import rospy
import actionlib
import actionlib.msg
import sys, select
import assignment_2_2022.msg
from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry
from assignment_2_2022.msg import custom_msg
from std_srvs.srv import *
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist, Pose, Point

import ipywidgets as widgets
import jupyros as jr
import time
from assignment_2_2022.srv import service_goals, service_goalsRequest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import math
%matplotlib widget
```

Now we have the callback function *publish_msg* of the subscriber to create a custom message and to publish it on the topic */odom* with the difference that there is a little part that allow us to see every 100ms the position of the robot

```
def publish_msg(message):
   
    global publisher
    global last_time_published_odom
        
    # Get the position and velocity
    pos_x = round(message.pose.pose.position.x, 1)
    pos_y = round(message.pose.pose.position.y, 1)
    vel_x = message.twist.twist.linear.x
    vel_y = message.twist.twist.linear.y

    # Creation of the custom message
    custom_message = custom_msg()
    
    custom_message.actual_x = pos_x
    custom_message.actual_y = pos_y
    custom_message.actual_vel_x = vel_x
    custom_message.actual_vel_y = vel_y
    
    # Publishing the custom message
    publisher.publish(custom_message)
    
    # This part is necessary to see costantly the robot position every 100ms
    current_time = time.time() * 1000
    if current_time - last_time_published_odom > 100:
        print("\rRobot position: x={}, y={}".format(pos_x, pos_y), end='')
        last_time_published_odom = current_time
```

Then we have 2 functions: one for the button to send the goal and another one to cancel the goal

```
def on_send_goal_button_clicked(b):
    # Call 'action_cliient' function
    action_client()
    
def action_client():
    global goal

    # Creation of the goal for the robot
    goal = assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningGoal()
    goal.target_pose.pose.position.x = w_coordinate_x.value
    goal.target_pose.pose.position.y = w_coordinate_y.value

    # Send goal to the server
    act_client.send_goal(goal)

def on_cancel_goal_button_clicked(b):
    global goal
    
    # Cancel the goal
    act_client.cancel_goal()
    
    goal = None
```

Obviously, we define buttons

```
# Widgets to give the goal coordinates
w_coordinate_x = widgets.FloatText(description='Coordinate X:', step = 0.1)
w_coordinate_y = widgets.FloatText(description='Coordinate Y:', step = 0.1)

# Button to send the goal
send_goal_button = widgets.Button(
description='Send goal to the robot',
layout = widgets.Layout(width = 'auto'))

send_goal_button.on_click(on_send_goal_button_clicked)

# Button to cancel the goal
cancel_goal_button = widgets.Button(
description='Cancel goal sent to the robot',
layout = widgets.Layout(width = 'auto'))

cancel_goal_button.on_click(on_cancel_goal_button_clicked)
```

If we want to see the distance from the closest obstacle, we have this (again, here we have the same part as for the robot position but in this case to see the distance every 100ms)

```
def callback_laser_scan(laser_scan):
    global last_time_published_laser
    
    # Only consider obstacles in a 180° field of view in front of the robot
    index_start = len(laser_scan.ranges) // 2 - (len(laser_scan.ranges) // 4)
    index_end = len(laser_scan.ranges) // 2 + (len(laser_scan.ranges) // 4)
    ranges = laser_scan.ranges[index_start:index_end]
    min_distance = round(min(ranges),1)
    
    # Print the distance every 100 ms
    current_time = time.time() * 1000
    if current_time - last_time_published_laser > 100:
        print("\rDistance from the closest obstacle: {}".format(min_distance), end='')
        last_time_published_laser = current_time
```

Now we have a function that we need to take values of counters of goals reached and canceled from the service /Nobe_B and these values will be used into the plot

```
def call_Node_B():
    # Creation of the service client to send the request for goals reached and canceled
    rospy.wait_for_service('/Node_B')
    Node_B_serviceProxy = rospy.ServiceProxy('/Node_B', service_goals)
    response = Node_B_serviceProxy.service_goalsRequest()
    return response
```

At this point, we have 2 classes: one to plot the robot position with the goal position and the path of the robot, and another one to plot the values of the goals reached and canceled

```
# Animation class used to plot the robot's position and goal's position
class PositionVisualizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Init function
        self.fig, self.ax = plt.subplots()
        # Settings for robot's position plot
        self.ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'bo', label = 'Robot position')
        # Settings for target's position plot
        self.goal_ln, = plt.plot([], [], 'r*', markersize = 10, label = 'Goal position')
        # Robot's position data arrays
        self.x_data, self.y_data = [], []
    
    def plot_init(self):
        # Set axis limits
        self.ax.set_xlim(10, -10)
        self.ax.set_ylim(10, -10)
        # Set the grid
        self.ax.grid(True, color = 'lightgrey')
        # Set the title
        self.ax.set_title('Robot position to the goal position')
        # Set the legend
        self.ax.legend(loc = 'upper right')
        
        return self.ln, self.goal_ln
    
    def odom_callback(self, message):
        # Callback function to update the data arrays
        self.x_data.append(message.pose.pose.position.x)
        self.y_data.append(message.pose.pose.position.y)
    
    def update_plot(self, frame):
        # Update the robot position plot
        self.ln.set_data(self.x_data, self.y_data)

        # With this, we can delete the goal marker into the plot
        if goal is not None:
            self.goal_ln.set_data(goal.target_pose.pose.position.x, goal.target_pose.pose.position.y)
        else:
            self.goal_ln.set_data([], [])
        return self.ln, self.goal_ln
        
# Animation class used to plot the number of goals reached and canceled into a bar chart
class GoalsVisualizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the figure and axis
        self.fig, self.ax = plt.subplots()
        self.ax.set_title('Goals reached and canceled')
        
        # Set up the initial values for the two bars
        self.count_goals_reached = 0
        self.count_goals_canceled = 0
        
        # Set up the horizontal grid
        self.ax.grid(axis = 'y', color = 'grey', linestyle = '-', alpha = 0.5)
        
        # Set up the x-axis tick labels
        self.labels = ('Goals Reached', 'Goals Canceled')
        self.x_pos = np.arange(len(self.labels))
        self.ax.set_xticks(self.x_pos)
        self.ax.set_xticklabels(self.labels)
        
        # Set up the y-axis range and ticks
        self.ax.set_ylim([0, 10])
        self.ax.set_yticks(np.arange(0, 11, 1))
        
        # Set up the bar chart
        self.bar_colors = ['red', 'blue']
        self.bar_plot = self.ax.bar(self.x_pos,
                                    [self.count_goals_reached, self.count_goals_canceled],
                                    align = 'center',
                                    color = self.bar_colors,
                                    width = 0.2)
        
    def goals_callback(self, message):
        # Get the number of goals reached and canceled
        response = call_service()
        self.count_goals_reached = response.count_goals_reached
        self.count_goals_canceled = response.count_goals_canceled
        
    def update_plot(self, frame):
        # Update the values of the two bars
        self.red_val = np.random.randint(0, 100)
        self.blue_val = np.random.randint(0, 100)
        
        # Update the heights of the bars
        for i, bar in enumerate(self.bar_plot):
            if i == 0:
                bar.set_height(self.count_goals_reached)
            else:
                bar.set_height(self.count_goals_canceled)
                
            bar.set_color(self.bar_colors[i])
        
        return self.bar_plot
```

The last part is to inizialize the node and other entities like publisher, action client etc..

```
# Creation of the node A
rospy.init_node('Jupyter')

# Creation of the Publisher
publisher = rospy.Publisher('/position_and_velocity', custom_msg, queue_size = 1)
    
# Creation of the action client
act_client = actionlib.SimpleActionClient('/reaching_goal', assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningAction)

# Waiting the server
act_client.wait_for_server()
    
# Initialization
goal = None
```

### How to run the file
To see the _robot position_, run this cell

```
last_time_published_odom = 0
jr.subscribe('/odom', Odometry, publish_msg)
```

To see the _distance from the closest obstacle_, run this cell

```
last_time_published_laser = 0
jr.subscribe('/scan', LaserScan, callback_laser_scan)
```

To see the _interface_, run this cell

```
display(widgets.HBox([w_coordinate_x, w_coordinate_y]))
display(widgets.HBox([send_goal_button, cancel_goal_button]))
```

To see the plot of the _robot position and goal position_, run this cell

```
# Create the visualizer object
position_visualizer = PositionVisualizer()
    
# Subscriber for the odom topic
sub = rospy.Subscriber('/odom', Odometry, position_visualizer.odom_callback)

# Plot
position_animation = FuncAnimation(
    position_visualizer.fig,
    position_visualizer.update_plot,
    init_func = position_visualizer.plot_init,
    cache_frame_data = False)
plt.show(block = True)
```

To see the plot of the _goals reached and canceled_, run this cell

```
# Create the visualizer object
goals_visualizer = GoalsVisualizer()

# Subscriber for the goals visualizer
sub_result = rospy.Subscriber('/reaching_goal/result', assignment_2_2022.msg.PlanningActionResult, goals_visualizer.goals_callback)

goals_visualizer_animation = FuncAnimation(
    goals_visualizer.fig,
    goals_visualizer.update_plot,
    interval = 1000,
    cache_frame_data = False)
plt.show(block = True)
```

## Third Task
The last one consists of performing a statistical analysis on the first assignment of Research Track 1, considering two different implementations (mine and a
solution of one of my colleagues) and testing which one performs better, when silver and golden tokens are randomly placed in the environment.
